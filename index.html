                        A black hat hacker historically has been used to describe one who has malicious intent -- such as theft of information, fraud or disrupting systems -- but increasingly, more specific terms are being used to describe those people. A hacker may exploit security vulnerabilities for monetary gain; steal or destroy private data; or alter, disrupt or shut down websites and networks.

                        A white hat hacker, often referred to as an ethical hacker, conducts security assessments to identify vulnerabilities within systems, applications, and networks. With explicit permission from organizations, 
                        they simulate cyberattacks to uncover weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

                        These hackers typically have a background in cybersecurity and are invited by organizations to test their systems for vulnerabilities before a product launch or major update. They are similar to white hat hackers and  are also usually external to the organization, providing an unbiased assessment of the system's security.

                        These hackers fall in between white and black hat hackers. They may identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems without authorization but do so without malicious intent, often to inform the system owner of the security issue. Their actions can be seen as both helpful and harmful, depending on the context.

                        Red hat hackers focus on taking down or stopping black hat hackers using aggressive tactics. While their intentions may be noble, their methods can be controversial, as they might employ the same techniques used by black hat hackers, potentially crossing ethical lines.

                        A green hat hacker is considered a newbie in the hacking world. As the name suggests, this person is "green" meaning very new and has little understanding of the security mechanisms and inner workings of the web. However, this group is usually highly motivated to learn and eager to advance their position/reputation as a hacker in the community.

                        A purple hat hacker is a type of hacker that straddles the line between ethical and malicious hacking. They have hacking skills and knowledge similar to black hat hackers, but they use those abilities in a more ambiguous or uncertain way, not always adhering to strict ethical guidelines. Purple hat hackers may engage in activities that are technically illegal or unethical, but they claim to have good intentions, such as testing system vulnerabilities to improve security.
